<h1>Growing Up</h1>
<p>My child hood in my opinion was the best years of my life. I was advneturous, had no responsibilities, and played all day. When I was in elementary school every summer I went to my grandparents house. That's where I learned how to drive four wheelers, went camping, and a lot more of activities. I also loved to watch t.v (especially Disney channel). One of my favorite shows was Wizards of Wavery place. During 4th grade my family moved from Moberly to Columbia. Columbia is where I lived most of my life. I became more active in sports and continued playing basketball. During middle school I also tried volleyball and cheer. I would say middle school is where I was discovering more of my interests. In highschool, I decided to stick with basketball but only played my freshman year. After some events happened in my life I decided to quit and focus more on school. During my Junior year of highschool is when covid hit and I had to get used to being online. I was on discord more and would be on there for hours playing games. I feel this is where I became more interested in being online..</p>
