<h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>

<h3>Art</h3>
<p>I've always had a interest in drawing and painting. Although I don't have many profesional projects I would say I am pretty creative.
My favorite things to paint are landscapes and I love to draw whatever I am feeling.
 I want to get into more realism art. In school I took my favorite class Digital Media
 where I learned a lot about Adobe cloud. This is where I gained my interest for
 illustrator and photoshop.</p>

 <h3> Physical Activity</h3>
 <p>I also really enjoy being active and being outisde. I usually try to go to the gym three times a week. I also like getting a bunch of people together and playing sand volleyball and other games.</p>
