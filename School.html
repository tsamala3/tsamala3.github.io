<h1>School</h1>
<p>This is my first semester at Mizzou. I transfered from MACC which is also here in Columbia. I am a townie and have been in school at Columbia most of my life. I trandsfered with 60 credits but plan to graduate in may 2025. I am majoring in Inormation Technology. Before starting at mizzou I actually wanted to pursue Orthodontics. I shadowed a few times and talked to some profesionals and decided I did not want to continue. I was slightly lost in wanted I wanted to do but came across IT and really enjoyed it.</p>

<h1>Classes</h1>
<p>I am currently in a few different IT coding classes including INFOTC 1000 and INFOTC 1040.

Here is an example of a code I did for class</p>


def perform_calculation():

try:
    filename = input("Input the filename: ")

    with open(filename) as file:
        column = file.readlines()
        numbers = [int(num) for num in column]
        print("File Name: ", filename)
        print("Sum: ", sum(numbers))
        print("Count: ", len(numbers))
        print("Average: ", sum(numbers)/len(numbers))
        print("Maximum: ", max(numbers))
        print("Minimum: ", min(numbers))
        print("Range: ", max(numbers) - min(numbers))

except Exception as error:
    print(error)
def main(): while True: perform_calculation() response = input("Would you like to evaluate another file? (y/n)") if (response == "y"): print("") continue else: break
